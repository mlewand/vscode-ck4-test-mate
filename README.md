# CKEditor 4 test mate

Very simple extension to make working with CKEditor 4 tests easier. So far it's created as a side project to check if all macros can be moved to VSC.

## Features

Currently the only command available is to run current file inside of the browser.

By default you can also access it with `ctrl + shift + alt + u` hotkey
